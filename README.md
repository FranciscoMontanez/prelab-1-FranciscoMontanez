##Overview

The goal of this pre-lab is to help prepare us for the "Log processing lab". In particular we'll provide a set of potentially useful readings on particular topics that might be useful, and do three small exercises:

- [ ] Write a small "helper" shell script that will be useful when doing the lab itself.
- [ ] See how we can use that helper script to construct HTML/Javascript files that use the Google Charts tools to generate a nice graph.
- [ ] Experiment a little with regular expressions.

The *pre-lab* is an *individual* project, but the lab will be done in pairs. You should again fork this repository and do your work in your copy. You should turn in the URL for your repository in whatever way the instructor requests.

## Pre-lab readings and resources

Read the **entire** lab in advance (<https://github.umn.edu/UMM-CSci3403-F15/lab1/wiki>) and definitely ask questions, especially conceptual ones.

Below is a list of some key tools we'll use a lot in this lab. Some were covered in readings associated with the previous lab; others have links to potentially useful material that you should at least skim before lab.

* Bash command line arguments : Top of <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-bash2/index.html>
* Bash loops : <http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop/>, <http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/loops1.html>
* awk : http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/01/awk-introduction-tutorial-7-awk-print-examples/, http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html
* sed : http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html, http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/sed.html
* grep : http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/grep.html, http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html
* Google's charting tools : http://code.google.com/apis/chart/
* http://linux.die.net/abs-guide/textproc.html has a ton of info on the tools mentioned above along with others that will likely prove useful in the lab (e.g., `wc`, `head`, `sort`, etc.)

There's obviously tons of information on-line about all these tools, so feel free to search for other sources of info if these aren't working for you. You should do some background reading on/playing with these things before lab, though, so you don't spend all of the lab period Googling around for info on these tools.
